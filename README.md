# Neural-Network

A simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits. This project is based off [this tutorial](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael 
Nielson and [this Youtube series](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk) on neural networks.
This project was meant as a way to learn about neural networks, so the only reference used was the theory and equations described.

The network was trained on the [mnist handwritten digits database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

The trained network currently has an accuracy of around 94% on the training data, and 93% on the test data. 

#### Planned improvements:
Currently the network is fairly basic. Michael Nielson's tutorial goes over several ways to improve the network, including a new cost function.
