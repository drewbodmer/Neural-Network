# Neural-Network

A first attempt at building a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits. This project is based off [this tutorial](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael 
Nielson and [this Youtube series](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk) on neural networks.
This project was built as a learning project, so I did my best to not look at any previously-written code for neural networks. 

#### To test the project:
Run the test.py file to test the trained network and get an accuracy reading.


#### To retrain the network:
Run the train.py file
