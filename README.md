# Neural-Network

A simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits. This project is based off [this tutorial](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael 
Nielson and [this Youtube series](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk) on neural networks.
This project was meant as a way to learn about neural networks, so the only reference used was the theory and equations described.

The trained network currently has an accuracy of around 94% on the training data, and 93% on the test data.
